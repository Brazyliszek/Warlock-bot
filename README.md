# Warlock-bot
automation some play aspects of game Tibia

Idea:
    Is to make a tool that will automate runemaking and make a chance for user to survive player attack or any other interruption by setting alarm modes and checks. Main goal is to help the players but also not to destroy old tibia community by massive rune farming so clients to operate was reduced to two at the same time.


Bot main functions:
*   fully configurable runemaker, which can create blank runes, moves them to hand if necessery and others
*   works with all Tibia clients - 7.1, 7.4, 7.6, otclient, medivia, 8.0, 8.6, tibia 11.0 and more!
*   on-time screen checker for changes on selected window (screen check takes about 30ms)
*   alarm system on lack of food, blank runes or screenchange which can be configured to logout, shutdown, play sound or walk desired directon
*   allow you to throw conjured runes wherever you want (for example house)
*   easy tool to obtain pictures of ingame items
*   it stores last used settings, so you won't have to configure it everytime you close the bot
